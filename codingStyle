Variable declaration : 
  All local variables should  start with a small letter and declared at the
  top of the function
  
  use `var` only as most of the project already has a lot of var declarations
   
  eg: afterRender() {
    var  background = "#fffff";
    var json = {};
     
    ....
    ....
  }
   
Imports
  use `require` not `import` as the project is already using lot of require
   
  Eg: 
  var ListView = require("@juspay/mystique-backend").androidViews.ListView;


Function;
  Max lines ~ 50 [Shouldnt be  crazy long]
  See `ComplexToolbar`.js on how to split the render into multiple functions

    
HorizontalLineLength: 
    Wrong eg: <LinearLayout orientation="vertical" root="true" width="match_parent" height="match_parent">
    

    Shouldnt be this much long harder to read
     
    <LinearLayout
      orientation="vertical"
       root="true"
       width="match_parent" 
       height="match_parent">
        

Events: 
  All the callbacks should be  of signature   
   
    <LinearLayout
      onClick={this.handle.....}
      orientation="vertical"
       root="true"
       width="match_parent" 
       height="match_parent">
       

    where .... can be userNameChange
    where .... can be userPasswordChange
    where .... can be submit
