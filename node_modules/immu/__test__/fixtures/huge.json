With this focus in mind, I love to create beautiful, classic interiors that  juxtapose modern and traditional elements.  Each and every fixture and finish is hand selected to withstand the test of time.  \n\nI relish mixing high and low (in my wardrobe as well as my interiors!), so no matter your budget I can work with you to achieve the home of your dreams.

I started working in the Architecture/Design Industry right out of high school.  I started as a drafter and worked my way up to designer and project manager.  With 8+ years experience in healthcare, I’ve discovered what environments make people simply feel good.  My passion has always been in residential design, so I decided to get involved with Laurel & Wolf and offer my services online.  I’m very excited to help families and individuals feel fantastic in their homes or work spaces!\n\nI am a wife and mother of two small boys.  My design taste has expanded significantly since my kids came along.  I liked things very simple, with no knick knacks, and then my first son was born and I had to relinquish control of my small house to toys and various baby items.  I now thoroughly enjoy anything adult and sophisticated.  I like to combine fun pops of color with classic neutrals and understand the importance of organization and storage furniture.\n\n",

She draws her inspiration from fashion, travel, music, dance, cooking, and all forms of art.  When she’s not working, you can find her out shopping for a bargain or cuddled up with a nice glass of wine.  Genessa loves dyi projects and isn’t afraid to get her hands dirty.  \n\nGenessa began her design career after graduating with honors from an accelerated program at FIDM, where she acquired the tools she needed to be successful in the Interior Design field.  Post graduation she landed a position working for a high-end residential designer in the greater LA area where she continued to hone her skills.  Genessa just recently branched out on her own and is opening her own interior & event design studio.  She enjoys a challenge and specializes in a variety of design styles.  \n\nGenessa is excited about expanding into e-Design because she’s able to help people who wouldn’t be able to hire a traditional designer.  Her philosophy is that everyone deserves a beautiful inviting space to come home to. \n “I look forward to chatting with you and helping you turn your vision into a reality, let’s get started!” \n\n–\tGenessa S.\n",

                "professional-bio": "\"My love of Interior Design began in my Brooklyn, NY childhood home, where I re-arranged my mothers furniture and admired her 1970's red shag rug! Now, some 40 years later, that love has grown into a passion for designing beautiful, livable spaces that suite individual client needs. After formal education at Sheffield School of Interior Design in 2001, my passion only continued to grow to appreciate the many facets of residential design, and the impact a well designed space can make on those who dwell in it! In addition to residential Interiors, I am also Dual Certified as an International Staging and ReDesign Professional (ISRP). As Principal Interior Designer at Perfect Piece Interiors, I pride myself on making sure my clients needs are met!\"",
